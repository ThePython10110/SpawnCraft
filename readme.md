# SpawnCraft
A mod for MineClone that allows players to craft spawners and spawn eggs. It is currently functional, but incomplete; I just need to do a ton of tedious copying/pasting/editing.

I think the recipes are reasonably fair (all of them require Ancient Debris or Netherite), and they can be individually toggled off in the Settings menu.

## Full list of recipes:
*Note: All recipes do appear in the recipe book, so this isn't technically necessary. I will probably eventually add screenshots of the recipes.*
### Spawner:
8 iron bars around 1 Netherite block
### Spawn eggs:
**Zombie**
```
|Egg         |Rotten Flesh  |Egg         |
|Rotten Flesh|Ancient Debris|Rotten Flesh|
|Egg         |Rotten Flesh  |Egg         |
```
*or combine a husk egg with rotten flesh (assuming husk eggs are craftable)*

**Husk**
```
|Egg |Rotten Flesh  |Egg |
|Sand|Ancient Debris|Sand|
|Egg |Rotten Flesh  |Egg |
```
*or combine a zombie egg with sand (assuming zombie eggs are craftable)*

# I'll finish this later.
